# Disease-Prediction-System-using-Machine-Learning
This project develops a machine learning–based disease prediction system using patient symptoms as input. It applies data preprocessing, class balancing, and multiple classifiers such as Decision Tree, Random Forest, Naive Bayes, and SVM to generate accurate and reliable disease predictions
